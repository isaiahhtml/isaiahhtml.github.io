It's hard.

NA Salary is too opaque. They're protecting it so much. All I see is the 
overspending from previous years.

All I have so far is 
[minimum salary stated by a Riot Official in 2017.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/20/16679430/league-of-legends-na-lcs-permanent-teams)

Minimum salary of $75,000 annual during 2017.

Which I adjusted with US Gov's 
[inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm).

$97,473.53 in inflation data 2024.


Role multiplier based on 
[LEC 2025 salary report](https://www.sheepesports.com/en/articles/exclusive-everything-about-lec-salaries-unveiled-or-lec-wooloo/en)
by Sheep Esports.

Based in order of average LEC salary 2025 by role:
- MID - 1.0
- JNG - 0.8
- BOT - 0.6
- TOP - 0.4
- SUP - 0.2

### What I got so far:

player market value:
adjusted minimum salary X age function X role multiplier

And I haven't taken into account previous year's performance which is hard to 
calculate too.
